READ ME FOR THE AUT APP


The AUT App Currently has the following functioning features:

- The AUT Map will show all the AUT City Campus Buildings with their respective names.  There is a menu that will take the camera to the selected building, toggle the map view and traffic.

- The AUT Bus Times will show a dynamic list of departing buses for all AUT Shuttle routes.  The list will attempt to provide a ETD for the buses and only show the next buses to depart.

- The link to the Snake Game will function provided the snake game is actively installed

- The AUT Events provides proof of concept for the idea of showing a list of up coming events for AUT.

- The settings menu for the entire app is a place holder for possible future development
